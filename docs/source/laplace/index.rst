Introduction
===================================

The Laplace approximation (McKay, 1992) is a method to quantify the uncertainty of a neural network.
It is based on the assumption that the posterior distribution of the weights of a neural network is Gaussian.
The Laplace approximation is a fast and simple method to approximate the posterior distribution of the weights of a neural network.
In this document, we will explain the Laplace approximation and how to use it in the context of Bayesian neural networks.
